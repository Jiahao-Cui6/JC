# Exploring the Relationship between environmental factors and marathon performance

### Background
The purpose of this study is to investigate how environmental factors, temperature, humidity,
 solar radiation, and wind, impact marathon performance across the lifespan in both men and
 women, with the hypothesis that older individuals will experience more pronounced slowing in
 high WBGT conditions compared to younger individuals, and similar trends will be observed
 in both men and women.

### Results
 This study examines how environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, solar radia
tion, wind, and WBGT,air quality impact marathon performance across ages and genders. We
 introduced the adjusted percentage current course record (Adjust_X.CR) to normalize finish
 times for a more accurate comparison. Performance generally improves from ages 15 to 30,
 followed by a steeper decline in females than in males. Environmental conditions significantly
 influence performance, with stability in good weather but a more pronounced decline with
 age in bad weather. Older individuals are especially sensitive to adverse conditions, and solar
 radiation and air quality were identified as the most influential factors, showing a complex,
 non-linear relationship with performance.
